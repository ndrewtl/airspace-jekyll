            <h2>About Us</h2>
          </div>
          <p>Our team includes undergradute students, graduates, PhD students and lecturers. We are all passionate for good teaching and improving quantitative skills. We believe that coding can be really fun and also understand the importance of quantitative skills for professional development. <b>We organise weekly workshops, complemented by <a href="https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/" target=”_blank”>online tutorials.</a></b> Coding Club is for everyone, regardless of their career stage or current level of R knowledge. </p>
	  <p> Our mission is to create a diverse learning community where we help each other to attain fluency in statistics and programming. If you would like to join us or learn more, please email <b>ourcodingclub@gmail.com</b>. You can also check out <a href="http://www.teaching-matters-blog.ed.ac.uk/?p=1129" target="_blank">our blog post on peer-to-peer teaching</a> on the Teaching Matters blog. <b>You can follow our coding adventures on <a href="https://twitter.com/our_codingclub" target="_blank">Twitter!</a></b> </p>
	  <p> Coding Club was jumpstarted with support from an <a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/development-alumni/iig" target="_blank">Innovation Initiative Grant</a> from the Edinburgh Fund at the University of Edinburgh. We organised our first joint workshop with the University of Aberdeen with the help of a GESA Innovation Initiative Grant. We are now taking Coding Club further with the help of a <a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/institute-academic-development/learning-teaching/funding/funding/previous-projects/year/march-2017/coding-club" target="_blank">Principal's Teaching Award Scheme</a> grant. We are working together with the <a href="http://e3dtp.geos.ed.ac.uk/" target="_blank">NERC E3 Doctoral Training Partnership</a>, which supports three of our team members (Gergana, John and Haydn).</p>
          <p><b><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1etKfW5HtOhrut9nBhl4dY8heoyJafAyC/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">You can find the schedule for the in-person Coding Club workshops in Edinburgh here.</a></b></p>
          <p><b>We are very keen to expand our team! We are looking for people interested in <a href="https://ourcodingclub.github.io/workshop/" target="_blank">contributing tutorials and/or hosting workshops</a> - get in touch if that's you!</b></p>

      <h2>WE BELIEVE IN GOOD TEACHING, INNOVATION AND GREAT IDEAS</h2>
      <p>We want to design effective and innovative ways to teach statistics and programming: we use a mix of individual and group work and we love coding challenges. <b>Coding Club is a place to generate new ideas and innovative ways to answer research questions.</b> Although our own work focuses on ecology and environmental science, the learning materials we create are easily transferable to other disciplines.</p>
      <p>So far, our tutorials cover themes such as how to write reproducible code, create beautiful and informative figures, use different type of models (e.g. mixed effects and mixture models) and more! You can check out our tutorials below and get in touch if you would like to contribute a tutorial.</p>

        <p><big><b>Coding Club is for everyone keen to learn about programming and statistics and how these skills can be applied in research. We want to create a jolly and diverse community where everyone has a voice and feels comfortable to express it. Our own team includes people from different backgrounds and nationalities and we are so happy to be working together. We want to establish the same ethos within Coding Club as a whole: Coding Club is a place that brings people together, regardless of their gender or background. We all have the right to learn, and we believe learning is more fun and efficient when we help each other along the way.</b></big></p>

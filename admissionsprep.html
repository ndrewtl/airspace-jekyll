          <h1>Pre Interview Project</h1>
          <p>
            In order to make sure all students can maximize their benefit from the course, all students must be at
            an expected level of technical competency before joining one of DFA's cohorts.
            <br />
            <br />
            Our Pre-Interview Project tests that you are familiar with front end development
            enough to build at least a small app using an API to interact with data. In order to work on this project you'll
            need to be familiar with these technologies:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-group">
            <li class="list-group-item">ReactJS (no Redux necessary, just basic React is fine)</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">JavaScript ES6</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">HTTP Requests</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">HTML/CSS</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">How to use the command-line/terminal enough to navigate around and execute programs</li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <h3 class="capitalize">Resources to get familiar with the above</h3>
          <p>Although this course isn't to teach you the basics above the above, it's possible you need to ramp up on any/all of the above in order to pass the interview for this course. Do not at all feel like you need to go through <i>all</i> of these resources. After you get the <strong>Pre-Interview Project</strong> you may just need to pick specific pieces to ramp up on in order to work on it.
             Also, if you come across anything useful on your own and would like to contribute to this list, shoot it over.</p>

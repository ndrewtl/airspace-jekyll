          <h4>How much does this cost?</h4>
          <p>This isn't our most important consideration for our first cohort. Most of the student applicants
          to this program are a bit tapped out from taking on loans for the first code camp they went to. If this is super interesting to you, just apply and we'll figure it out.</p><br />

          <h4>What's the course schedule?</h4>
          <p>Eventually we'll have a full time course but at the moment we're doing an evenings course that runs M-F 6-9, Saturdays 9-9. MST</p><br />

          <h4>When is the cohort starting?</h4>
          <p>It's not perfectly fixed at the moment but we're thinking Mid-Late August this year 2017</p><br />

          <h4>How do I get accepted?</h4>
          <p>There's a technical interview as well as a behavioral interview. We can schedule those with you for times during the evenings. They each last around an hour.</p><br />

          <h4>Is this an onsite or remote program?</h4>
          <p>I don't think it's technically either. We call it Virtual Onsite. Although you won't be at brick and mortar building that students commute to - wasting precious time, you won't feel like an isolated remote student either. Virtual Onsite is a new type of online participation that uses modern programs to immerse you into the group, making it feel like you're next to them. A typical response to this kind of program is "I learn better in person". Those kind of people will do well in the environment we have. You aren't gonna be strung out to dry with reading materials that you're expected to grasp all on your own.</p><br />

          <h4>Do I have to be in Utah to attend?</h4>
          <p>Nope. If you can make the schedule work for you and you get accepted, you're definitely welcome.</p><br />

          <h4>What kind of student gets accepted into this program?</h4>
          <p>This masters course isn't for students who are completely new to programming. Typically our students are either working professionals in a non-front end role, or students who came out of a bootcamp but didn't feel they learned enough to close the gap on a job. The right personality along with a technical aptitude are the biggest weights to getting accepted.</p><br />

          <h4>What's the difference between this course and the one I just went to?</h4>
          <p>
            If this about sums up your experience at the code camp you went to, then you're perfect for this.

          <h4>Why haven't I heard of you before?</h4>
          <p>This will be our first cohort. We consider DFA to be in "alpha" and are adjusting the price accordingly. It'll still be wicked beneficial to all students to join.</p><br />

          <h4>Is there a trial period?</h4>
          <p>Yes, if either the student or DFA don't feel like it's working out, you have the first week (no cost) to decide if it's a program that's working for you</p><br />

          <h4>What kind of computer equipment will I need?</h4>
          <p>Most any modern computer will do. Preferably you should have at least two monitors as well.</p><br />

          <h4>What's the course schedule?</h4>
          <p>Eventually we'll have a full time course but at the moment we're doing an evenings course that runs M-F 6-9 MST, Saturdays 9-9 MST. </p><br />

          <h4>When is the cohort starting?</h4>
          <p>It's not perfectly fixed at the moment but we're thinking Mid-Late August this year 2017</p><br />

          <h4>How do I get accepted?</h4>
          <p>There's a technical interview as well as a behavioral interview. We can schedule those with you for times during the evenings. They each last around an hour.</p><br />

          <!-- <h4>What does the technical interview consist of?</h4>
          <p></p><br /> -->

          <h4>Is this an onsite or remote program?</h4>
          <p>I don't think it's technically either. We call it Virtual Onsite. Although you won't be at brick and mortar building that students commute to - wasting precious time, you won't feel like an isolated remote student either. Virtual Onsite is a new type of online participation that uses modern programs to immerse you into the group, making it feel like you're next to them. A typical response to this kind of program is "I learn better in person". Those kind of people will do well in the environment we have. You aren't gonna be strung out to dry with reading materials that you're expected to grasp all on your own.</p><br />

          <h4>What frameworks or technologies will be taught?</h4>
          <p>Although we'll be use ReactJS as our base Front end Framework, advanced JavaScript as well as deep front end patterns and paradigms will be focused. ReactJS isn't the goal - it's just a vechicle to get you Front end proficient.</p><br />

          <h4>What kind of student gets accepted into this program?</h4>
          <p>This masters course isn't for students who are completely new to programming. Typically our students
            are either working professionals in a non-front end role, or students who came out of a bootcamp but didn't
            feel they learned enough to close the gap on a job. The right personality along with a technical aptitude are
            the biggest weights to getting accepted.
            <br />
            <br />

          </p><br />



          <h4>How much does this cost?</h4>
          <p>Our first cohort is going to be 1/10 of what we're projecting our normal cost to be for the program. $400. If you have extenuating circumstances and can't pay that for whatever reason, reach out and we'll see if we can work something out.</p><br />


          <h4>What's the difference between this course and the one I just went to?</h4>
          <p>
            If this about sums up your experience at the code camp you went to, then you're perfect for this.
            <ul class="list-group">
              <li class="list-group-item">
                Lots of small projects worked on alone

              <li class="list-group-item">
                Didn't feel like you learned how to learn (helpless outside of the one framework focused on)

              <li class="list-group-item">
                Didn't walk away feeling confident that your decisions are close to what professionals would do.
              </li>
              <li class="list-group-item">
                Are ambitious and driven to succeed but couldn't get a job after your code camp.
              </li>
              <li class="list-group-item">
                Feel like you hacked your way through all solutions and your instructors were satisfied that "they worked".

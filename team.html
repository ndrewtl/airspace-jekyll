            <h2>Gergana Daskalova</h2>
          <p>I am a PhD student interested in biodiversity change, agroecology, landscape ecology, conservation policy and the potential of abandoned agricultural land for biodiversity conservation. My research project aims to quantify the effects of land use change on global and local patterns of species richness, abundance and composition. I am absolutely fascinated by the power of good education in helping people reach and exceed their potential and dream big. My own dream is to become a lecturer and researcher at least as inspirational and empowering as the mentors that I have been fortunate to have so far. For more information, check out <a href="https://adventurousandefficient.com/" target="_blank">my personal website</a> and Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/gndaskalova" target="_blank">@gndaskalova</a>. I am part of the <a href="http://e3dtp.geos.ed.ac.uk/" target="_blank">NERC E3 Doctoral Training Programme</a> at the University of Edinburgh and I'm also a <a href="http://www.carnegie-trust.org/carnegiephdscholars2017/gergana-daskalova" target="_blank">Carnegie scholar.</a></p>

            <h2>John Godlee</h2>
          <p>I am a first year PhD student from the University of Edinburgh where I research how the canopy structure of savanna ecosystems is changing due to climate change. I have used R on a range of projects, from analysing employee satisfaction data for a private equity firm to mining linguistic transcripts for speech patterns. Through my own work, I have gained experience in using R for statistical modelling, mapping, data manipulation and R-markdown to make reproducible scripts. I have experience designing sustainable projects through my work in nature conservation and as the student representative for the Edinburgh University School of GeoSciences. I’m very interested in the role of open-source and collaborative technology in academia. I am part of the <a href="http://e3dtp.geos.ed.ac.uk/" target="_blank">NERC E3 Doctoral Training Programme.</a></p>

            <h2>Claudia Meca</h2>
          <p>I'm in my 4th (and last!) year of my undergraduate degree in Ecological and Environmental Sciences. My interests lie in sustainable development and peaceful coexistence with nature i.e. permaculture and my passion is definitely wildlife conservation! My dissertation will focus on biodiversity changes and ecosystem interactions across altitudes, with access to data from cloud forests in Peru and alpine tundra in Canada. For this, I will of course, be using R. I was introduced to R two years ago and since then have become fascinated by with what computers can produce with a simple script of code. It has been a love-hate relationship (but mostly love) and I want to show as many people as possible that coding is not as abstract or inaccessible as it looks!</p>

          <p>I'm an undergraduate in my final year studying ecological & environmental sciences at the University of Edinburgh, with my honours project focusing on quantifying the above-ground carbon stored in Arctic ecosystems. Over the years I've delved into many projects, from founding Elpis Solar, a non-profit developing solar-powered infrastructure for refugee camps, to establishing the Edinburgh Mindfulness Ambassador Award and Social Innovation Forum. Coding Club is a unique opportunity for students across the department of Geosciences to broaden their knowledge and advance their field through working at the intersection of Environmental Science and Informatics. I am excited to be part of this journey!</p>

            <h2>Sandra Angers-Blondin</h2>
          <p>I am a third year PhD student investigating the responses of tundra vegetation to climate change in the Arctic and the role of plant-plant interactions in modifying these responses. I have been using statistical programming since the beginning of my PhD and am therefore very familiar with the R language. I have experience teaching coding to undergraduate students as a demonstrator on the course “Ecological and Environmental Analysis”. I am excited to be part of this project, as I wish a similar opportunity had been available when I started teaching myself programming. </p>

          <p>I’m a third year <a href="http://e3dtp.geos.ed.ac.uk/" target="_blank">NERC E3 DTP</a> PhD student investigating the causes and consequences of vegetation change in the tundra biome. My research requires a range of coding tools and software, from using GitHub repositories to hierarchical Bayesian modelling (which I still haven’t quite grasped yet!). I had never even used R before starting my PhD, so a course like this earlier on in my research career would have been immensely valuable: this is a great opportunity to pass on the skills I have learnt onto others. I have a large amount of teaching experience, both as a tutor for Masters and Undergraduate course and as a demonstrator in previous statistics classes, and have been previously nominated for a teaching award.</p>

          <p>I'm a PhD student investigating the main floristic patterns and their environmental drivers in Lowland Tropical South America and how these patterns will change due to climate change. Through my project, I gained experience in handling large quantities of data in R, as well as in using different R packages and clustering methods. I began to consistently use this software in my research when I started my PhD and, because of this, I see how valuable an initiative such as Coding Club is for students and young researchers who want/need to acquire coding and data management skills in R.  </p>

            <h2>Gabriela Hajduk</h2>
          <p>I’m an evolutionary behavioural ecologist, with a particular interest in reproductive and social behaviours. I’m currently doing my PhD at the University of Edinburgh working on the superb fairy-wren (Malurus cyaneus). The main focus of my project is to explore the dynamics of inbreeding and infidelity, investigating context-dependent mate choice and the effects of the social environment in this cooperative breeder. Most of my time is spent working with a long-term dataset and modeling in R, however I also carry out fieldwork investigating the interactions between fairy-wren mothers and their sons in Australia.

            <h2>Kat Keogan</h2>
          <p>I am an ecologist interested in the effects of environmental change on marine ecosystems. For my PhD I am studying breeding phenology in seabirds, and the way in which they respond to changing conditions. I am researching the patterns, drivers and mechanisms of breeding phenology in a range of seabird species with diverse life history traits. I’m particularly interested in phenological trends on a global scale, and looking for patterns across phylogenetic groups or regions that might help us predict how species respond to environmental change.

          <p>I am currently in my fourth year studying Ecological and Environmental Sciences at the University of Edinburgh. Having proficient coding skills promises to become of more importance as I enter my final year. In particular, to aid with independent research projects such as my dissertation. Being a class representative for my degree programme has given me the opportunity to talk to peers about potential ways to increase student support in this area. Joining a research expedition this summer lead by Dr Isla Myers-Smith has taught me valuable techniques such as technical expertise, data analysis and ethics in the field, while enabling me to work with a team of scientist who are experts in their field.</p>

          <p>I’m a fourth-year ecology student looking for ways to improve my R skills without having to read books about it alone in a darkened room. I've been a member of Team Shrub since November 2014, including the 2015 field season, from which I gained direct experience in scientific practice, including some coding. I’ve been trying to practice R whenever I can, but it’s difficult to know what’s possible of myself and the software without some outside help. Considering how important R is for modern ecology, this course should give me some of the skills I need to improve both my final year’s work and anything beyond.</p>

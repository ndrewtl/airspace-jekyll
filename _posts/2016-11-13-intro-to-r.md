In our first tutorial we will begin to explore "R" as a tool to analyse and visualise data.

R is a statistical programming language that has rapidly gained popularity in many scientific fields. The main difference between R and other statistical softwares like Minitab or SPSS is that R has no graphical user interface. There are no buttons to click and no dropdown menus, R can be run entirely by typing commands into a text interface. While this might seem daunting, hopefully by the end of this tutorial you will see how R can help you to do better statistical analysis.

So why are we using R and not one of the many other statistical packages like MATLAB, Minitab, or even Microsoft Excel? Well, R is great because:

##### - R is free and open source, and always will be! Anybody can use the code and see exactly how it works.
##### - Because R is a programming language rather than a graphical interface like Minitab, the user can easily save scripts as small text files for use in the future, or share them with collaborators.
##### - R has a very active and helpful online community, normally a quick google is all it takes to find somebody who has fixed the problem you're having. You can also check out our <a href="https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2016/11/15/troubleshooting.html" target="_blank">Troubleshooting in R tutorial!</a>

R was developed by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman and is an open source implementation of the "S" programming language, so next time you need a fun R fact, you can start with "Did you know that before R, there was S?".

Practice is the best way to learn any new language, so in this tutorial we will jump straight in and do some of our own statistical analysis using a publicly available dataset of occurrence records for many animal, plant, and fungi species. We downloaded the records for 2000-2016 (from the NBN Gateway https://data.nbn.org.uk/), and saved them as `edidiv.csv`, which you can find in this <a href="https://github.com/ourcodingclub/CC-1-RBasics" target="_blank">Github repository</a>. 

To provide some extra functionality and to ease the transition a bit, we will be using a program called RStudio as a graphical front-end to R. 

<a name="download"></a>

### 1. Download R and RStudio

You can download R from <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/" target="_blank">CRAN (The Comprehensive R Archive Network)</a>. Select the link appropriate for your operating system. 

Then download RStudio from <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/" target="_blank">the RStudio website</a> (select the free open source desktop version).  

If you are using a Mac, in addition to R and RStudio, you need to download XQuartz (<a href="https://www.xquartz.org/" target="_blank">available here</a>).

### All the files needed to complete this tutorial can be downloaded from this <a href="https://github.com/ourcodingclub/CC-1-RBasics" target="_blank">Github repository</a>. 

<b>Click on Download Zip and unzip the files - later on we will learn more about using Github.

### Open RStudio. Click on <i>File/New File/R script</i>. 

You will now see a window like the one above. You can type code directly into the console - pressing enter at the end of the line runs the code. You can also write your code in the script file in the top left window. To run a line of code from your script, press <i>Ctrl+R</i> on Windows and <i>Cmd+Enter</i> on a Mac. __If you enter code directly into the console it will not be saved by R, so by first typing your code into a script file you are creating a reproducible record of your analysis. Remember to click <i>Save</i> often, so that you actually save your script!__. Like any piece of writing, scripts benefit from structure and clarity - you can check out our <a href="https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2017/04/25/etiquette.html" target="_blank">Coding Etiquette tutorial for more details.</a>

When writing a script, it's useful to add comments to describe your analysis by inserting a `#` in front of a line of text. Begin your script by recording who is writing the script, the date, and the main goal - in our case, determining how many species from different taxa have been recorded in Edinburgh. Here's an example:

```r
# Coding Club Workshop 1 R Basics
# Learning how to import and explore data, and make graphs through investigating Edinburgh's biodiversity
# Written by Gergana Daskalova 6/11/16 University of Edinburgh
```

The next few lines of code usually load the packages you are using for you analysis. A package is a bundle of commands that can be loaded into R, to provide extra functionality. For example you might load a package for formatting data, or for making maps. 

To install a package, type `install.packages("package-name")`. You only need to install packages once, afterwards you just need to load them using `library(package-name)`. Here we will be using the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html" target="_blank"> `dplyr` package</a> to provide extra commands for formatting and manipulating data. 

The next lines of code should define your "working directory". This is a folder on your computer where R will look for data, where plots will be saved etc. To find out where your working directory is now, run the code `getwd()`. If you want to change it, you can use `setwd()`. Set you working directory to the folder you just downloaded from github:

```r
install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)
# Note that there are quotation marks when installing a package, but not when loading it

setwd("C:/User/CC-1-RBasics-master")
# This is an example filepath, alter to your own filepath
```

Note that on a Windows computer, although the file path you copy will have backslashes separating the folders (`"C:\folder\data"`), the filepath you enter into R should use forward slashes (`"C:/folder/data"`). 

<a name="import"></a>

### 2. Import and check data

<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/1htdMJy.png" alt="Img" style="width: 960px;"/></center>

In RStudio you can either click on <i>Import dataset</i> and navigate to where you have saved your file, or use the `read.csv()` command. A window will pop up previewing your data, make sure that next to <i>Heading</i> you've selected <i>Yes</i> (this tells R to treat the first row of your data as the column titles) and click <i>Import</i>. If you click on <i>Import dataset</i>, afterwards in the console you will see the code for your import, which includes the file path - it's a good idea to copy that code into your script, so that for future reference you know from where you imported your dataset and which dataset you used. R works best with `.csv` (comma separated values) files - if you entered your data in Excel, you would need to click on <i>Save as</i> and select `csv` as the file extension. When entering data in excel, don't put any spaces in your row names, as they will confuse R later. Some computers save `.csv` files with semicolons `;`, not commas `,` as the separators, it usually happens when English is not the first or only language on your computer. If your files are separated by semicolons, use `read.csv2` instead of `read.csv`.

```r
edidiv <- read.csv("C:/Users/user/Desktop/Coding Club Endeavours/edidiv.csv")
# This is the file path based on where I saved the data, your filepath will be different
```

__R is an object-based language - this means that the data you import and any values you make later are stored in objects that you name. The arrow `<-` is how you assign objects - here we assigned our csv file to the object `edidiv`. In the top right window of RStudio you can see the names of any objects currently loaded into R.__

__When you import your data into R, it will most likely become an object called a data frame. A data frame is like a table - it has rows and columns with the different variables and observations you have loaded.__

A really important step is to check that your data imported without any mistakes. It's good practice to always run this code - do you see any missing values, do the numbers/names make sense? If you go straight into analysis, you risk later finding out that R didn't read your data correctly and having to re-do it, or worse, analysing wrong data without noticing.

```r
head(edidiv)                # Displays the first few rows
tail(edidiv)                # Displays the last rows
str(edidiv)                 # Tells you whether the variables are continuous, integers, categorical or characters

# You'll notice the taxonGroup variable is a character variable, but it should be a factor (categorical variable), so we'll force it to be one.

edidiv$taxonGroup <- as.factor(edidiv$taxonGroup)
dim(edidiv)                 # Displays number of rows and columns
summary(edidiv)             # Gives you a summary of the data
summary(edidiv$taxonGroup)  # By using the dollar sign, you refer to a particular variable (column) in your dataset
```

__`str(object.name)` is a great command - so often analyses in R go wrong because you think your variable is continuous, yet somehow R has decided it is a factor. It's always a good idea to double check. A factor is a categorical variable, e.g. the different treatments you might have used in your experiment - `drought`, `flood`, `control`. Factors can also be different species names, sites, and any categories by which you are sorting your data. Continuous variables can be numeric or integers, and character variables are just words or strings of words.__

<a name="richness"></a>

### 3. Calculate species richness

__Our `edidiv` object has occurrence records of various species collected in Edinburgh from 2000 to 2016. To explore Edinburgh's biodiversity we will create a graph showing how many species were recorded in each taxonomic group.__ You can calculate species richness in Excel, but that has several disadvantages, especially when working with large datasets like ours - you have no record of what you clicked on, how you sorted the data and what you copied/deleted - accidental mistakes can slip by without you noticing. In R, on the other hand, you have your script, so you can go back and check all the steps in your analysis.

First, we need to split edidiv into multiple objects, each containing rows for only one taxonomic group. You need to do the following steps for all of the taxa in the data, here we have given examples for the first two.

```r
Beetle <- filter(edidiv, taxonGroup == "Beetle")
Bird <- filter(edidiv, taxonGroup == "Bird")
# You can create the objects for the remaining taxa. If you need to remind yourself of the names, type `summary(edidiv$taxonGroup)`

# To find out the number of different species in each taxa, we will use the function `unique()` to single out different species and the function `length()` to count them
a <- length(unique(Beetle$taxonName))
b <- length(unique(Bird$taxonName))
# You can choose whatever names you want for your objects, here I used a,b,c,d... for the sake of brevity.
```

If you see an error saying `R` can't find the object `Beetle` or similar, chances are you either haven't installed and/or loaded the `dplyr` package. Go back and install it using `install.packages("dplyr")` and then load it using `library(dplyr)`.

<a name="vector"></a>

### 4. Create a vector and plot it

You're probably noticing a pattern in the code above - and a lot of copying and pasting! That's not particularly efficient - in future tutorials we will learn how to use more of `dplyr`'s functions and achieve the same result with way less code! Now we can combine all those values in a vector, which is done using the `c()` function (c stands for concatenate), and add labels with `names()`.

```r
biodiv <- c(a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k)
names(biodiv) <- c("Beetle",
                   "Bird",
                   "Butterfly",
                   "Dragonfly",
                   "Flowering.Plants",
                   "Fungus",
                   "Hymenopteran",
                   "Lichen",
                   "Liverwort",
                   "Mammal",
                   "Mollusc")
```

Notice:

- The spaces in front of and behind `<-`, after `,` and around `==`, those are added to make it easier to read the code. 
- All the labels have been indented on a new line - otherwise the line of code gets very long and hard to read. 
- Take care to check that you are matching your vector values and labels correctly - you wouldn't want to label the number of beetles as lichen species! This would have been way easier to check if the objects were called e.g. `beetle_sp`, not `a` - the good thing about keeping a script is that we can go back and check that we have indeed assigned the number of beetle species to `a`.

__We can now visualise species richness with the `barplot()` function.__ Plots appear in the bottom right window in RStudio. 


```r
barplot(biodiv)
```

There's a few things not quite right that we should fix - there are no axis titles, not all column labels are visible, and the value for plant species (n=521) exceeds the highest value on the y axis, so we need to extend it. The great thing about R is that you don't need to think of the code to fix that all on your own - you can use the `help()` function and see what code you need to add in. Look through the help output, what code do you need to add in?

```r
help(barplot)     # For help with the barplot() function
help(par)         # For help with plotting in general
```

We also want to save our plot. To do this click <i>Export</i>. If you don't change the directory, the file will be saved in your working directory. You can adjust the dimensions to get the bar chart to look how you like it, and you should also add in a meaningful file name - `Rplot01.png` won't be helpful when you try to find the file later.

You can also save your file by wrapping the code in the `png()` and `dev.off()` functions.

```r
png("barplot.png", width=1600, height=600)
barplot(biodiv, xlab="Taxa", ylab="Number of species", ylim=c(0,600), cex.names= 1.5, cex.axis=1.5, cex.lab=1.5)
dev.off()
# The cex code increases the font size
```

### 5. Create a data frame and plot it

The objects we created before were called vectors, which are a series of values, each with a label. This object type is suitable when dealing with just one set of values. Often however, you will have more than one variable and have multiple data types - e.g. some continuous, some categorical. In those cases, we use data frame objects. __Data frames are tables of values, a two-dimensional structure with rows and columns where each column can have a different data type. Another possible data format is a matrix - a matrix can have several rows of data as well (e.g. you can combine vectors into a matrix), but the variables are all of the same type, for instance they are all numerical, and are the same length in terms of the number of rows.__

We will now create a data frame with our species richness data and then save it using `write.csv()`, so that should we need it later, we can use the csv file straight away. We will use the `data.frame()` function, but first we will create an object that contains the names of all the taxa and another object with all the values for the species richness of each taxon.

```r
# Creating an object called "taxa" that contains all the taxa names
taxa <- c("Beetle",
          "Bird",
          "Butterfly",
          "Dragonfly",
          "Flowering.Plants",
          "Fungus",
          "Hymenopteran",
          "Lichen",
          "Liverwort",
          "Mammal",
          "Mollusc")
# Turning this object into a factor, i.e. a categorical variable
taxa_f <- factor(taxa)
# Combining all the values for number of species in an object called richness
richness <- c(a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k)
biodata <- data.frame(taxa_f, richness)
write.csv(biodata, file="biodata.csv")
# The csv file will be saved in your working directory
```

If we want to create and save a barplot using the data frame, we need to slightly change the code - because data frames can contain multiple variables, we need to tell R exactly which one we want it to plot. Like before, we can specify columns from a data frame using `$`:

```r
png("barplot2.png", width=1600, height=600)
barplot(biodata$richness, names.arg=c("Beetle",
                                      "Bird",
                                      "Butterfly",
                                      "Dragonfly",
                                      "Flowering.Plants",
                                      "Fungus",
                                      "Hymenopteran",
                                      "Lichen",
                                      "Liverwort",
                                      "Mammal",
                                      "Mollusc"),
        xlab="Taxa", ylab="Number of species", ylim=c(0,600))
dev.off()
```

## What is R Markdown?

R Markdown allows you to create documents that serve as a neat record of your analysis. In the world of reproducible research, we want other researchers to easily understand what we did in our analysis, otherwise nobody can be certain that you analysed your data properly. You might choose to create an `RMarkdown` document as an appendix to a paper or project assignment that you are doing, upload it to an online repository such as Github, or simply to keep as a personal record so you can quickly look back at your code and see what you did. `RMarkdown` presents your code alongside its output (graphs, tables, etc.) with conventional text to explain it, a bit like a notebook.

`RMarkdown` uses <a href="http://www.markdowntutorial.com" target="_blank">`Markdown` syntax</a>. `Markdown` is a very simple 'markup' language which provides methods for creating documents with headers, images, links etc. from plain text files, while keeping the original plain text file easy to read. You can convert Markdown documents to many other file types like `.html` or `.pdf` to display the headers, images etc..

To see what `RMarkdown` is capable of, have a look at this <a href="https://github.com/ourcodingclub/CC-2-RMarkdown/blob/master/UnderGrad_Dissertation_Rmd.pdf" target="_blank">undergraduate dissertation</a>, which gives a concise log of their statistical analysis, or the completed demo <a href="https://github.com/ourcodingclub/CC-2-RMarkdown/blob/master/RMarkdown_Tutorial_Demo_Rmd.Rmd" target="_blank">`RMarkdown` file</a> for this tutorial.

All the resources for this tutorial, including some helpful cheatsheets can be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/ourcodingclub/CC-2-RMarkdown" target="_blank">this repository</a>. __Clone and download the repo as a zip file, then unzip it.__

__Read through this tutorial and use the information you learn along the way to convert the tutorial R script (`RMarkdown_Tutorial.R`), which you can find in the repo, into a well commented, logically structured R Markdown (`.Rmd`) document. Afterwards, there are some challenge scripts that you can convert to `.Rmd` documents. If you want, you could also try converting one of your own R scripts.__

__Haven't used R or RStudio before? No worries! Check out our <a href="https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2016/11/13/intro-to-r.html" target="_blank">Intro to R and RStudio tutorial</a>, then come back here to master `RMarkdown`!__

<a name="download"></a>

## Download R Markdown
To get `RMarkdown` working in RStudio, the first thing you need is the `rmarkdown` package, which you can get from <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rmarkdown/index.html" target="_blank">CRAN</a> by running the following commands in R or RStudio:

``` r
install.packages("rmarkdown")
library(rmarkdown)
```
<a name="create"></a>

## Create an `RMarkdown` file

To create a new `RMarkdown` file (`.Rmd`), select `File -> New File -> R Markdown...`_ in `RStudio`, then choose the file type you want to create. For now we will focus on a `.html` `Document`, which can be easily converted to other file types later.

The newly created `.Rmd` file comes with basic instructions, but we want to create our own `RMarkdown` script, so go ahead and delete everything in the example file. 

Now save the `.Rmd` file to the repository you downloaded earlier <a href="https://github.com/ourcodingclub/CC-2-RMarkdown" target="_blank">from Github</a>.

Now open the `RMarkdown_Tutorial.R` practice script from the repository you downloaded earlier in another tab in `RStudio` and use the instructions below to help you convert this script into a coherent `RMarkdown` document, bit by bit.

If you have any of your own `R` scripts that you would like to make into an R Markdown document, you can also use those! 

<a name="identify"></a>

## The different parts of an R Markdown file

### The YAML Header

At the top of any `RMarkdown` script is a `YAML` header section enclosed by `` --- ``. By default this includes a title, author, date and the file type you want to output to. Many other options are available for different functions and formatting, see <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/html_document_format.html" target="_blank">here for `.html` options</a> and <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/pdf_document_format.html" target="_blank">here for `.pdf` options</a>. Rules in the header section will alter the whole document. Have a flick through quickly to familiarise yourself with the sorts of things you can alter by adding an option to the `YAML` header. 

Insert something like this at the top of your new `.Rmd` script:

```
---
title: "Edinburgh Biodiversity"
author: John Doe
date: 22/Oct/2016
output: html_document
---
```

By default, the `title`, `author`, `date` and `output` format are printed at the top of your `.html` document. This is the minimum you should put in your header section. 


Now that we have our first piece of content, we can test the `.Rmd` file by compiling it to `.html`. To compile your `.Rmd` file into a `.html` document, you should press the `Knit` button in the taskbar:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/Knit_HTML_Screenshot.jpg" alt="Img">

Not only does a preview appear in the `Viewer` window in `RStudio`, but it also saves a `.html` file to the same folder where you saved your `.Rmd` file.

<a name="insert"></a>

### Code Chunks

Below the `YAML` header is the space where you will write your code, accompanying explanation and any outputs. Code that is included in your `.Rmd` document should be enclosed by three backwards apostrophes ```` ``` ```` (grave accents!). These are known as code chunks and look like this:

````
```{r}
norm <- rnorm(100, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```
````

Inside the curly brackets is a space where you can assign rules for that code chunk. The code chunk above says that the code is R code. We'll get onto some other curly brace rules later.

__Have a go at grabbing some code from the example R script and inserting it into a code chunk in your `.Rmd` document.__

You can run an individual chunk of code at any time by placing your cursor inside the code chunk and selecting `Run -> Run Current Chunk`:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/run_sel.png" alt="Img">


### More on Code Chunks

It's important to remember when you are creating an `RMarkdown` file that if you want to run code that refers to an object, for example:

````
```{r}
plot(dataframe)
```
````

you must include instructions showing what `dataframe` is, just like in a normal R script. For example: 

````
```{r}
A <- c("a", "a", "b", "b")
B <- c(5, 10, 15, 20)
dataframe <- data.frame(A, B)
plot(dataframe)
```
````

Or if you are loading a dataframe from a `.csv` file, you must include the code in the `.Rmd`: 

````
```{r}
dataframe <- read.csv("~/Desktop/Code/dataframe.csv")
```
````

Similarly, if you are using any packages in your analysis, you will have to load them in the `.Rmd` file using `library()` as in a normal `R` script. 

````
```{r}
library(dplyr)
```
````

### Hiding code chunks

If you don't want the code of a particular code chunk to appear in the final document, but still want to show the output (e.g. a plot), then you can include `echo = FALSE` in the code chunk instructions. 


````
```{r, echo = FALSE}
A <- c("a", "a", "b", "b")
B <- c(5, 10, 15, 20)
dataframe <- data.frame(A, B)
plot(dataframe)
```
````

Similarly, you might want to create an object, but not include both the code and the output in the final `.html` file. To do this you can use, `include = FALSE`. Be aware though, when making reproducible research it's often not a good idea to completely hide some part of your analysis:

````
```{r, include = FALSE}
richness <- 
  edidiv %>%
    group_by(taxonGroup) %>%
    summarise(Species_richness = n_distinct(taxonName))
```
````

__REMEMBER: R Markdown doesn't pay attention to anything you have loaded in other R scripts, you MUST load all objects and packages in the R Markdown script.__

## Inserting Figures
Inserting a graph into `RMarkdown` is easy, the more energy-demanding aspect might be adjusting the formatting.

By default, `RMarkdown` will place graphs by maximising their height, while keeping them within the margins of the page and maintaining aspect ratio. If you have a particularly tall figure, this can mean a really huge graph. To manually set the figure dimensions, you can insert an instruction into the curly braces:

````
```{r, fig.width = 2.5, fig.height = 7.5}
ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y) + geom_point()
```
````

By default, figures are rendered as `.png` files by R Markdown, which can lead to loss of quality if your document is rescaled. You can change that to `.svg`, a vector file format by adding `dev = 'svg'` to the code chunk instruction section.

````
```{r, fig.width = 2.5, fig.height = 7.5, dev = 'svg'}
ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y) + geom_point()
```
````

## Inserting Tables

While R Markdown can print the contents of a data frame easily by enclosing the name of the data frame in a code chunk:

````
```{r}
dataframe
```
````

this can look a bit messy, especially with data frames with a lot of columns. Including a formal table requires more effort.

The most aesthetically pleasing and simple table formatting function I have found is `kable()` in the `knitr` package. The first argument tells kable to make a table out of the object `dataframe` and that numbers should have two significant figures. Remember to load the `knitr` package in your `.Rmd` file as well.

````
```{r}
kable(dataframe, digits = 2)
```
````

If you want a bit more control over the content of your table you can use ``pander()`` in the `pander` package. Imagine I want the 3rd column to appear in italics:

````
```{r}
emphasize.italics.cols(3)  # Make the 3rd column italics
pander(richness_abund)  # Create the table
```
````

Find more info on pander <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pander/pander.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

You can also manually create small tables using markdown syntax.

For example: 

```
| Plant | Temp. | Growth |
|:------|:-----:|-------:|
| A     | 20    | 0.65   |
| B     | 20    | 0.95   |
| C     | 20    | 0.15   |
```

will create something that looks like this:

<style type="text/css">
.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}
.tg td{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;}
.tg th{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;}
.tg .tg-yw4l{vertical-align:top}
</style>
<table class="tg">
  <tr>
    <th class="tg-yw4l"><b>Plant</b></th>
    <th class="tg-yw4l"><b>Temp.</b></th>
    <th class="tg-yw4l"><b>Growth</b></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">A</td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">20</td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">0.65</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">B</td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">20</td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">0.95</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">C</td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">20</td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">0.15</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The ``:-----:`` tells markdown that the line above should be treated as a header and the lines below should be treated as the body of the table. Text alignment of the columns is set by the position of ``:``:

<style type="text/css">
.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}
.tg td{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;}
.tg th{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;}
.tg .tg-yw4l{vertical-align:top}
</style>
<table class="tg">
  <tr>
  <th class="tg-yw4l"><b>Syntax</b></th>
  <th class="tg-yw4l"><b>Alignment</b></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">`:----:`</td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">Centre</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">`:-----`</td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">Left</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">`-----:`</td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">Right</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">`------`</td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">Auto</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Formatting Text

Markdown syntax can be used to change how text appears in your output file. Here are a few common formatting commands:

`*Italic*` 

*Italic*

<hr>

`**Bold**`

**Bold**

<hr>

This is  \`code` in text 

This is `code` in text

<hr>

`# Header 1`

# Header 1

<hr>

`## Header 2`

## Header 2

Note that when a `#` symbol is placed inside a code chunk it acts as a normal R comment, but when placed in text it controls the header size.

<hr>

`* Unordered list item`

<li> Unordered list item </li>

<hr>

`1. Ordered list item`

1. Ordered list item

<hr>

`[Link](https://www.google.com)`

[Link](https://www.google.com)

<hr>

`$A = \pi \times r^{2}$`

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/Inline_eq_ex.png" alt="Img" style="width:175px">

The `$` symbols tell R markdown to use <a href="http://reu.dimacs.rutgers.edu/Symbols.pdf" target="_blank">LaTeX equation syntax</a>.

 
<a name="pdf"></a>

## Creating `.pdf` files in Rmarkdown

Creating `.pdf` documents for printing in A4 requires a bit more fiddling around. RStudio uses another document compiling system called <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/" target="_blank">LaTeX</a> to make `.pdf` documents.

If you are using Windows, go to <a href="https://miktex.org/download" target="_blank">MikTeX</a> and download the appropriate "Complete MikTeX Installer" for your system, either 32-bit or 64-bit.

If you are using a Mac, go to <a href="https://tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html" target="_blank">MacTeX</a> and download the "MacTeX.pkg".

Running these installers will install a version of LaTeX onto your system, which R will then be able to call on to compile the `.pdf`.

Becoming familiar with <a href="https://tobi.oetiker.ch/lshort/lshort.pdf" target="_blank">LaTeX syntax</a> will give you a lot more options to make your R Markdown `.pdf` look pretty, as LaTeX commands are mostly compatible with R Markdown, though some googling is often required.

To compile a `.pdf` instead of a `.html` document, change `output:` from `html_document` to `pdf_document`. 

## Common problems when compiling a `.pdf`

- Text is running off the page

Add a `global_options` argument at the start of your `.Rmd` file:

````
```{r global_options, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message=FALSE, 
tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=60)) 
```
````

This code chunk won't be displayed in the final document due to the `include = FALSE` call and should be placed immediately after the YAML header to affect everything below that. 

`tidy.opts = list(width.cutoff = 60)` defines the margin cutoff point and wraps text to the next line. Play with the value to get it right.


<hr> 

- I lose my syntax highlighting

Use the `xelatex` engine to compile your `.pdf`:

````
- - -
author: John Doe
output: pdf_document 
latex_engine: xelatex
- - -
````

By default, R markdown uses the base LaTeX engine to compile pdfs, but this may limit certain options when it comes to formatting. There are lots of other engines to play around with as well.

<hr>

- My page margins are too big/small

Add a `geometry` argument to the YAML header

````
- - - 
title: "R Markdown Tutorial Demo"
author: "John Godlee"
date: "30/11/2016"
output: pdf_document
latex_engine: xelatex
geometry: left = 0.5cm, right = 1cm, top = 1cm, bottom = 1cm
- - - 
````

`geometry` is a LaTeX command.

<hr>

- My plot/table/code is split over two pages

Add a page break before the dodgy element:

````
\pagebreak
```{r}
Codey codey code code
```
````

<hr>

- I want to change the font

Add a font argument to your header section

```{}
--- 
title: "R Markdown Tutorial Demo"
author: "John Godlee"
date: "30/11/2016"
output: pdf_document
latex_engine: xelatex
mainfont: Arial
--- 
```

`mainfont` is a LaTeX command.

## Have a go yourself

At this point, if you haven't been following through already, have a go at converting the tutorial R script (`RMarkdown_Tutorial.R`) into a `.Rmd` document using the information above as a guide.

Remember that a good R markdown document should provide a reproducible log of your code, properly commented, with subtitles, comments and code relevant output so the reader knows what is going on.

<a name="notebook"></a>

## `R` Notebooks

`RMarkdown` outputs to a non-interactive file format like `.html` or `.pdf`. When presenting your code, this means you have to make a choice, do you want interactive but messy looking code (`.Rmd`) or non-interactive but neat looking code (`.html`, `.pdf`)?

R notebooks provide a file format that combines the interactivity of a `.Rmd` file with the attractiveness of `.html` output.

R notebooks output to the imaginatively named `.nb.html` format. `.nb.html` files can be loaded into a web browser to see the output, or loaded into a code editor like RStudio to see the code.

Notebooks use the same syntax as `.Rmd` files so it is easy to copy and paste the script from a `.Rmd` into a Notebook. To create a new R Notebook file, select `File -> New File -> R Notebook`. Create a notebook from your newly created `.Rmd` file by copying and pasting the script. Alternatively, to turn any existing `.Rmd` file into an `R` notebook, add `html_notebook: default` under the `output:` argument in the YAML header. It's okay if you have more than one output type. For example, this code would give you a `pdf` and an `R notebook.

```{}
--- 
title: "R Markdown Tutorial Demo"
author: "John Godlee"
date: "30/11/2016"
output:
pdf_document: default
latex_engine: xelatex
mainfont: Arial
html_notebook: default
--- 
```

To output to `.nb.html`, first make sure all your code chunks have been run:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/Notebook_Run.jpg" alt="Img">

then click _Preview_:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/Notebook_Preview.jpg" alt="Img">

Notice that with R Notebooks you can still output to `.html` or `.pdf`, the same as a `.Rmd` file.

R notebooks have only been around for about a couple of years so they're not perfect yet, but may replace R markdown in the future for many applications.

__Note: R Markdown Notebooks are only available in RStudio 1.0 or higher.__

## Bonus task!

Either in a small group or on your own, convert one of the three demo R scripts into a well commented and easy to follow R Markdown document, or R Markdown Notebook. The files (`RMarkdown_Demo_1.R`, `RMarkdown_Demo_2.R`, `RMarkdown_Demo_3.R`) can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/ourcodingclub/CC-2-RMarkdown" target="_blank">repo you downloaded earlier</a>. 


# Tutorial Outcomes:

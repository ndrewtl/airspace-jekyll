At it's core, Shiny is merely an R package like `dplyr` or `ggplot2`. The package is used to create web-applications, but uses the R language rather than javascript, HTML5, or CSS, which are traditionally used for web applications. By using R, Shiny provides an efficient method of creating web applications designed around data presentation and analysis.

If you're unsure what a web-app is, look at this [gallery](http://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/) of basic apps made using Shiny.

## What are Shiny Apps useful for?

- Exploring data
- Teaching others
- Sharing results with collaborators
- Engaging with the public
- Giving presentations
- Looking clever!

## Downloading Shiny and tutorial resources

To get Shiny in RStudio the first thing you need is the `shiny` package, which you can get from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/shiny/index.html) by running the code below in RStudio:

```r
install.packages("shiny")
```

You can download the resources for this tutorial by heading to <a href = "https://github.com/ourcodingclub/CC-11-Shiny">the repository for this tutorial</a>, and forking it to your own Github account. Clone the repository on your computer using SSH or HTTPS to download the files or just download the folder as a zip file. <a href = "https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2017/02/27/git.html">See our Git and Github tutorial for more info.</a>

<a name="structure"></a>

## The Shiny app file structure

Next, select _File/ New File/ Shiny Web App..._, give the application a descriptive name and change the Application type to "_Single File (app.R)_", save the app in an appropriate directory and click _Create_.

RStudio generates a template R script called `app.R`.

Notice that the name you gave to your app was assigned to the directory, not the app script file. For your app to work, the file must remain named `app.R`!

It is possible to create a Shiny app with two files called `ui.R` and `server.R`, but the same can be accomplished by using one file. In the past, Shiny apps had to be created using two files, but the Shiny package has since been updated to allow the single file app structure, making things much tidier. You will see some tutorials on the internet using the old two file structure but these can be easily translated to the one file structure. This tutorial will assume you have the one file app structure.

Now we can set up the rest of the directories for your app. Add subdirectories called `Data` and a folder called `www` in your app directory. `Data` will hold any data used by the app and `www` will hold any images, and other web elements.

To review, a Shiny application requires this specific directory structure to work properly:

![Img]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/Dir_Screenshot.jpg)

<a name="layout"></a>

## app.R layout

Now that the directory structure is set up, head back to RStudio to start building `app.R`. A basic `app.R` file consists of these four parts:

- A section at the top of the script, loading any packages needed for the app to run, `shiny` is required at the very least but others like `dplyr` or `ggplot2` could be added when they are needed:

  ```r
  library(shiny)
  ```

- An object called `ui` which contains information about the layout of the app as it appears in your web browser. `fluidPage()` defines a layout that will resize according to the size of the browser window, all the app code will be placed within the brackets.

  ```r
  ui <- fluidPage()
  ```

- An object called `server` which contains information about the computation of the app, creating plots, tables, maps etc. using information provided by the user. All the app code will be placed within the curly brackets.

  ```r
  server <- function(input, output) {}
  ```

- A command to run the app, this should be included at the very end of `app.R`. It tells shiny that the user interface comes from the object called `ui` and that the server information (data, plots, tables, etc.) comes from the object called `server`.

  ```r
  shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
  ```

Create a basic shiny app by copying the bits of code above into your `app.R`, __delete any example code generated when you created the file__.

## Layout of a Shiny App

Shiny apps are structured using panels, which are laid out in different arrangements. Panels can contain text, widgets, plots, tables, maps, images, etc.

[Here is a good set of examples on how the panel layout can be changed](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/layout-guide.html). In this tutorial we will be using a side bar layout (`sidebarLayout()`).

<a name="create"></a>

## Creating a Shiny App - Basic Syntax

To illustrate how to code a Shiny app, we will emulate a simple app that I wrote to explore some data on the productivity of Barley genotypes.

Open up the finished web app and have a look at it by entering this in a new R script file in RStudio:

```r
library(shiny)
runGitHub(repo = "CC-11-Shiny", username = "ourcodingclub", subdir = "Example_App")
```

The app should then open in your browser. 

You can get the app code and a helpful cheatsheet by downloading the github repository for this tutorial. __Go to <a href = "https://github.com/ourcodingclub/CC-11-Shiny">the repository for this tutorial</a>, and fork it to your own Github account. Clone the repository on your computer using SSH or HTTPS to download the files. For more details on how to do this, please check out our <a href = "https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2017/02/27/git.html"> Intro to Github for version control</a> tutorial.__

Looking at the app and comparing to the slideshow above we can see that the app has a `sidebarLayout` with a `sidebarPanel`, `mainPanel` and `titlePanel`. It uses a `selectInput` to choose the genotype of barley shown in the histogram and the table, another `selectInput` for the colour of the histogram, a `sliderInput` to choose the number of bins in the histogram, and a `textInput` to display some text in the app. The histogram is located in the `mainPanel` along with a table of the data being shown, while the inputs are in the `sidebarPanel`.

To re-create this app, go back to your `app.R` then we can make our basic app structure which we will fill later:

```r
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
  titlePanel(),  # Add a title panel
  sidebarLayout(  # Make the layout a sidebarLayout
    sidebarPanel(),  # Inside the sidebarLayout, add a sidebarPanel
    mainPanel()  # Inside the sidebarLayout, add a mainPanel
  )
)

server <- function(input, output) {}

runApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

`titlePanel()` indicates that we would like a separate panel at the top of the page in which we can put the title.

`sidebarLayout()` indicates that we want our Shiny app to have the sidebar layout, one of many layouts we saw above. Within `sidebarLayout` we have:

- `sidebarPanel()`, which indicates that we want a sidebar panel included in our app. Sidebar panels often contain input widgets like sliders, text input boxes, radio buttons etc.

- `mainPanel()`, which indicates that we want a larger main panel. Main panels often contain the output of the app, whether it is a table, map, plot or something else.

### Input widgets

Now that we have our basic structure we can start to fill it with inputs and outputs.

The example app has four input widgets, a `selectInput` for genotype, a `selectInput` for histogram colour, a `sliderInput` for number of bins, and a `textInput` to add some text. Each of these widgets provides information on how to display the outputs, the histogram and its accompanying table. In the example app, all the widgets are found in the `sidebarPanel` so the code for these widgets should be put in the `sidebarPanel` command:

```r
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
  titlePanel(),
  sidebarLayout(
     sidebarPanel(
                   selectInput(inputId = "genotype",  # Give the input a name "genotype"
                      label = "1\. Select genotype",  # Give the input a label to be displayed in the app
                      choices = c("A" = "a","B" = "b","C" = "c","D" = "d","E" = "e","F" = "f","G" = "g","H" = "h"), selected = "a"),  # Create the choices that can be selected. e.g. Display "A" and link to value "a"
                   selectInput(inputId = "colour", 
                      label = "2\. Select histogram colour", 
                      choices = c("blue","green","red","purple","grey"), selected = "grey"),
                   sliderInput(inputId = "bin", 
                      label = "3\. Select number of histogram bins", 
                      min=1, max=25, value= c(10)),
                   textInput(inputId = "text", 
                      label = "4\. Enter some text to be displayed", "")
                   ),
      mainPanel()
  )
)

server <- function(input, output) {}

runApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

Spend a couple of minutes looking at this code so you understand what it means, then enter into your own `app.R`.

Let's break down `selectInput()` to understand what is going on:

- `inputId = "genotype"` gives this input the name `genotype` which will become useful when referencing this input later in the app script.
- `label = "1\. Select genotype"` gives this input a label to be displayed above it in the app.
- `choices = c("A" = "a","B" = "b", ...` gives a list of choices to be displayed in the dropdown menu (`A, B, etc.`) and the value that is actually gathered from that choice for use in the output (`a, b, etc.`).
- `selected = "grey"` gives the value from the dropdown menu that is selected by default.

The arguments presented by the other input widgets can be investigated using `?textInput`for example, in the R console.

#### More Input Widgets

There are plenty of pre-made widgets in Shiny, here is a selection each with the minimum number of arguments needed when running the app, though many more can be added:

```r
actionButton(inputId = "action", label = "Go!")
```

```r
radioButtons(inputId = "radio", label = "Radio Buttons", choices = c("A", "B"))
```

```r
selectInput(inputId = "select", label = "select", choices = c("A", "B"))
```

```r
sliderInput(inputId = "slider", label = "slider", value = 5, min = 1, max = 100)
```

Notice how all of the inputs require an `inputId` and a `label` argument.

### Running a Shiny App

Take this opportunity to preview your app, click _Run App_:

![Img]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/Run_App_Screenshot.jpg)

or use the keyboard shortcut `Cmd + Opt + R` (Mac), `Ctrl + Alt + R` (Windows).

When a Shiny app is running in RStudio, the console cannot be used. To stop the app, click the _Stop_ button in the top right of the console window or press the `Esc` key.

![Img]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/Stop_Screenshot.jpg)

### Output

A Shiny app without any outputs is useless. Outputs can be in the form of plots, tables, maps, or text.

Coding an output is the same as in a normal R script.

As per our example app, we're going to be using `ggplot()` to create a histogram.

Outputs are created by placing code in the curly brackets (`{}`) in the `server` object:

```r
server <- function(input, output) {
  output$plot <- renderPlot(ggplot(Barley, aes(x = yield)) +  # Create object called `output$plot` with a ggplot inside it
  geom_histogram(bins = 7,  # Add a histogram to the plot
    fill = "grey"  # Make the fill colour grey
    data = Barley)  # Take data from `Barley`
  )                                                       
}
```

Look at the code above for a couple of minutes to understand what is going on, then copy and paste into your own `app.R`.

Basically, we are creating an object called `output$plot` and using `renderPlot()` to wrap a `ggplot()` command.

#### Reactive output

The histogram is great, but not particularly interactive. We need to link our input widgets to our output object.

For example, we want to select individual genotypes to display in our histogram which the user can select using the `selectInput` that we called `genotype` earlier. Use some base R wizardry, `[]` `$` and `==` to select the data we want:

```r
server <- function(input, output) {
  output$plot <- renderPlot(ggplot(Barley, aes(x = yield)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 7,
      fill = "grey",
      data = Barley[Barley$gen == input$genotype,]
  )
  )                                                       
}
```

`data = Barley[Barley$Genotype == input$select,]` tells `geom_histogram()` to only use data where the value in column `gen` is equal to (`==`) the value given by `input$genotype`. Note the `,` after `input$genotype` which indicates that we are selecting columns, and that all the rows should be selected.

Next, we want to be able to change the colour of the histogram based on the value of the `selectInput` called `colour`. To do this simply change fill = "grey" to `fill = input$colour`:

Next, we want to select the number of bins in the histogram using the `sliderInput` called `bin`. Simply change `bins = 7` to `bins = input$bin`

Finally, to create a table output showing the contents of whatever genotype is selected, create a new output object called `output$table` and use `renderTable()` to create a table:

```r
server <- function(input, output) {
  
  output$plot <- renderPlot(ggplot(Barley, aes(x = yield)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = input$bin,
               fill = input$colour,
               data=Barley[Barley$gen == input$genotype,]))
               
 output$table <- renderTable(Barley[Barley$gen == input$genotype,])
}
```

### Displaying output

To make the outputs appear on your app in the `mainPanel`, they need to be added to the `ui` object inside the `mainPanel()` command like so:

```r
ui <- 
  fluidPage(
    titlePanel(title = (h4("Barley Yield", align = "center"))),
    sidebarLayout(
      position = "right",
      sidebarPanel(h3("Inputs for histogram"), 
                   selectInput("genotype", "1. Select genotype", choices = c("A" = "a","B" = "b","C" = "c","D" = "d","E" = "e","F" = "f","G" = "g","H" = "h"), selected = "a"),
                   br(),
                   selectInput("colour", "2. Select histogram colour", choices = c("blue","green","red","purple","grey"), selected = "grey"),
                   br(),
                   sliderInput("bin", "3. Select number of histogram bins", min=1, max=25, value= c(10)),
                   br()
                   )
                   mainPanel(
                             plotOutput("plot"),
                             tableOutput("table")
                             )
      )
    )
```

Take this chance to preview your app again by clicking `Run` in RStudio.

### Additional elements

#### HTML

To make your app look more pretty, you can add HTML tags like in a normal HTML webpage. Below is a table of basic HTML tags, their shiny equivalent, and a description of what they do:

HTML    | shiny                                | Function
------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------
`<div>` | `tags$div()`                              | Defines a block with the same formatting
`<br>`  | `tags$br()`                               | Inserts a break
`<hr>`  | `tags$hr()`                               | Inserts a horizontal line
`<p>`   | `tags$p()`                                | Creates a paragraph of text
`<a>`   | `tags$a(href = "LINK", "displayed text")` | Creates a clickable link

A list of all HTML tags can be found using:

```r
shiny::tags
```

Some tags may conflict with other functions and so you should always state the source the function comes from by using `tags$`, e.g.:

```r
tags$div()
```

Tags can be stacked to apply many arguments to the same object/text, just as in HTML:

```r
tags$div(style="color:red",
  tags$p("Visit us at:"),
  tags$a(href = "https://ourcodingclub.github.io", "Coding Club")
  )
```

This creates a block of text that is coloured red (`style="color:red"`), within that block there is a paragraph of text (`tags$p("Visit us at?:")`) and a link (`tags$a(href = "http://ourcodingglub.github.io", "Coding Club")`).

Add it to your Shiny app in `mainPanel()` and see what happens!

For more information on the arguments that can be included in popular Shiny HTML tags, RStudio have a nice wiki at <https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/tag-glossary.html>.

### Exporting a finished app

It is easy to send a Shiny app to somebody else who also has RStudio. The easiest way is to send `app.R` alongside any data and other resources in a zip file to be unzipped by the recipient and run through R.

If you want to quickly share the app over the internet I recommend using [Github](gist.github.com) to host the file.

Go to [github.com](github.com), sign in with your account details and create a repo and upload everything from your local directory, including the `Data` and `www` directories. Remember to add another file called `readme.md` where you can write a quick explanation of the content of your app.

To send the app to another person give them your Github username and the name of the repo and ask them to run `runGithub()` like this in R:

```r
runGitHub(repo = "repo_name", username = "user_name")
```

Alternatively, if your recipient doesn't know how Github works, upload your app directory as a `.zip` file to Github and they can use `runUrl()` if you give them the url of the zipfile:

```r
runUrl("https://github.com/rstudio/shiny_example/archive/master.zip")
```

`runUrl()` can be used to run a Shiny app from a zip file if it is hosted anywhere on the internet, so you are not restricted to Github.

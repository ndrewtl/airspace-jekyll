<hr>

At it's core, Shiny is merely an R package like `dplyr` or `ggplot2`. The package is used to create web-applications, but uses the R language rather than javascript or HTML5 which are traditionally used for web applications. By using R, Shiny provides an efficient method of creating web applications designed around data presentation and analysis.

Below is an example of the basic Shiny app that we will be recreating in today's tutorial:

### Downloading Shiny and tutorial resources

To get Shiny in RStudio the first thing you need is the `shiny` package, by running the code below in RStudio:

```r
install.packages("shiny")
install.packages("rsconnect")  # For publishing apps online
```

You can download the resources for this tutorial by heading to <a href = "https://github.com/ourcodingclub/CC-11-Shiny" target="_blank">the repository for this tutorial</a>. You can click on `Clone / Download` and either download the zip file and extract the files, or fork the repository to your own Github account. <a href = "https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2017/02/27/git.html" target="_blank">See our Git and Github tutorial for more info.</a>

<a name="structure"></a>

## The Shiny app file structure

Next, select _File/ New File/ Shiny Web App..._, give the application a descriptive name (__no spaces__) and change the application type to "_Single File (app.R)_", save the app in an appropriate directory and click _Create_.

RStudio generates a template R script called `app.R`.

Notice that the name you gave to your app was assigned to the directory, not the app script file. For your app to work, the file must remain named `app.R`!

It is possible to create a Shiny app with two files called `ui.R` and `server.R`, but the same can be accomplished by using one file. In the past, Shiny apps had to be created using two files, but the Shiny package has since been updated to allow the single file app structure, making things much tidier. You will see some tutorials on the internet using the old two file structure but these can be easily translated to the one file structure. This tutorial will assume you have the one file app structure.

Now we can set up the rest of the folders for your app. Add a folder called `Data` and a folder called `www` in your app directory. `Data` will hold any data used by the app and `www` will hold any images, and other web elements.

To review, a Shiny application should have this specific folder structure to work properly:

```
Test_App
├── app.R
├── Data
│   └── data.csv
└── www
    └── A.jpg
```

<a name="layout"></a>

## app.R layout

Now that the folder structure is set up, head back to RStudio to start building `app.R`. A basic `app.R` consists of these five parts:

- A section at the top of the script, loading any packages needed for the app to run, `shiny` is required at the very least but others like `dplyr` or `ggplot2` could be added as they are needed:

```r
# Packages ----
library(shiny)  # Required to run any Shiny app
library(ggplot2)  # For creating pretty plots
library(dplyr)  # For filtering and manipulating data
library(agridat)  # The package where the data comes from
```

- A section loading any data needed by the app:

```r
# Loading data ----
Barley <- as.data.frame(beaven.barley)
```

- An object called `ui` which contains information about the layout of the app as it appears in your web browser. `fluidPage()` defines a layout that will resize according to the size of the browser window, all the app code will be placed within the brackets.

  ```r
  # ui.R ----
  ui <- fluidPage()
  ```

- An object called `server` which contains information about the computation of the app, creating plots, tables, maps etc. using information provided by the user. All the app code will be placed within the curly brackets.

  ```r
  # server.R ----
  server <- function(input, output) {}
  ```

- A command to run the app, this should be included at the very end of `app.R`. It tells shiny that the user interface comes from the object called `ui` and that the server information (data, plots, tables, etc.) comes from the object called `server`.

  ```r
  # Run the app ----
  shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
  ```

 __Delete any example code generated automatically when you created the file, and create a basic Shiny app by copying the bits of code above into your `app.R`. Your Shiny app script should now look like this:__


 ```r
 # Packages ----
 library(shiny)  # Required to run any Shiny app
 library(ggplot2)  # For creating pretty plots
 library(dplyr)  # For filtering and manipulating data
 library(agridat)  # The package where the data comes from

 # Loading data ----
 Barley <- as.data.frame(beaven.barley)

 # ui.R ----
 ui <- fluidPage()

 # server.R ----
 server <- function(input, output) {}

 # Run the app ----
 shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
 ```

### Layout of a Shiny App

Shiny apps are structured using panels, which are laid out in different arrangements. Panels can contain text, widgets, plots, tables, maps, images, etc.

<a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/layout-guide.html" target="_blank">Here is a good set of examples on how the panel layout can be changed</a>. The most basic layout uses `fluidRow()` and `column()` to manually create grids of a given size. `fluidRow()` allows a lot of customisation, but is more fiddly. In this tutorial we will be using `sidebarLayout()`, which creates a large panel and a smaller inset side panel.

<a name="create"></a>

## Creating a Shiny App - Basic Syntax

To illustrate how to code a Shiny app, we will emulate a simple app that I wrote to explore some data on the productivity of Barley genotypes.

#### <a href="https://johngodlee.shinyapps.io/barley_yield_exploration/" target="_blank">Open up the finished web app and have a look at it</a> 

You can get the code for this app by opening `app.R` in the `Example_app` folder in the tutorial repository which you downloaded earlier.

Looking at the app and comparing to the panel layout examples in the above link we can see that the app has a `sidebarLayout` with a `sidebarPanel`, `mainPanel` and `titlePanel`. It uses a `selectInput` to choose the genotype of barley shown in the histogram and the table, another `selectInput` for the colour of the histogram, a `sliderInput` to choose the number of bins in the histogram, and a `textInput` to display some text in the app. The histogram is located in the `mainPanel` along with a summary table of the data being shown, while the inputs are in the `sidebarPanel`.

To re-create this app, go back to your `app.R`. Now we can make our basic app structure, which we will fill later:

```r
# Packages ----
library(shiny)  # Required to run any Shiny app
library(ggplot2)  # For creating pretty plots
library(dplyr)  # For filtering and manipulating data
library(agridat)  # The package where the data comes from

# Loading data ----
Barley <- as.data.frame(beaven.barley)

# ui.R ----
ui <- fluidPage(
  titlePanel(""),  # Add a title panel
  sidebarLayout(  # Make the layout a sidebarLayout
    sidebarPanel(),  # Inside the sidebarLayout, add a sidebarPanel
    mainPanel()  # Inside the sidebarLayout, add a mainPanel
  )
)

# server.R ----
server <- function(input, output) {}

# Run the app ----
runApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

`titlePanel()` indicates that we would like a separate panel at the top of the page in which we can put the title.

`sidebarLayout()` indicates that we want our Shiny app to have the sidebar layout, one of many layouts we saw above. Within `sidebarLayout` we have:

- `sidebarPanel()` indicates that we want a sidebar panel included in our app. Sidebar panels often contain input widgets like sliders, text input boxes, radio buttons etc.

- `mainPanel()` indicates that we want a larger main panel. Main panels often contain the output of the app, whether it is a table, map, plot or something else.

### Input widgets

Now that we have our basic structure we can start to fill it with inputs and outputs.

The example app has four input widgets, a `selectInput` for genotype, a `selectInput` for histogram colour, a `sliderInput` for number of bins, and a `textInput` to add some  arbitrary text. Each of these widgets provides information on how to display the histogram and its accompanying table. In the example app, all the widgets are found in the `sidebarPanel` so the code for these widgets should be put in the `sidebarPanel` command:

```r
ui <- fluidPage(
  titlePanel("Barley Yield"),
  sidebarLayout(
     sidebarPanel(
                   selectInput(inputId = "genotype",  # Give the input a name "genotype"
                      label = "1\. Select genotype",  # Give the input a label to be displayed in the app
                      choices = c("A" = "a","B" = "b","C" = "c","D" = "d","E" = "e","F" = "f","G" = "g","H" = "h"), selected = "a"),  # Create the choices that can be selected. e.g. Display "A" and link to value "a"
                   selectInput(inputId = "colour", 
                      label = "2\. Select histogram colour", 
                      choices = c("blue","green","red","purple","grey"), selected = "grey"),
                   sliderInput(inputId = "bin", 
                      label = "3\. Select number of histogram bins", 
                      min=1, max=25, value= c(10)),
                   textInput(inputId = "text", 
                      label = "4\. Enter some text to be displayed", "")
                   ),
      mainPanel()
  )
)
```

Spend a couple of minutes looking at this code so you understand what it means, then enter into your own `app.R`.

Let's break down `selectInput()` to understand what is going on:

#### - `inputId = "genotype"` gives this input the name `genotype` which will become useful when referencing this input later in the app script.
#### - `label = "1\. Select genotype"` gives this input a label to be displayed above it in the app.
#### - `choices = c("A" = "a","B" = "b", ...` gives a list of choices to be displayed in the dropdown menu (`A, B, etc.`) and the value that is actually gathered from that choice for use in the output (`a, b, etc.`).
#### - `selected = "grey"` gives the value from the dropdown menu that is selected by default.

You can look into the arguments presented by the other input widgets by using the help function `?`, for example by running the code `?textInput` in the R console.

#### More Input Widgets

There are plenty of pre-made widgets in Shiny, here is a selection each with the minimum number of arguments needed when running the app, though many more can be added:

```r
actionButton(inputId = "action", label = "Go!")
```

```r
radioButtons(inputId = "radio", label = "Radio Buttons", choices = c("A", "B"))
```

```r
selectInput(inputId = "select", label = "select", choices = c("A", "B"))
```

```r
sliderInput(inputId = "slider", label = "slider", value = 5, min = 1, max = 100)
```

Notice how all of the inputs require an `inputId` and a `label` argument.

### Running a Shiny App

Take this opportunity to preview your app by clicking _Run App_:

![Img]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/Run_App_Screenshot.jpg)

or use the keyboard shortcut `Cmd + Opt + R` (Mac), `Ctrl + Alt + R` (Windows).

When a Shiny app is running from RStudio, the console cannot be used. To stop the app, click the _Stop_ button in the top right of the console window or press the `Esc` key.

![Img]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/Stop_Screenshot.jpg)

### Output

A Shiny app without any outputs is useless. Outputs can be in the form of plots, tables, maps, or text.

As per our example app, we're going to be using `ggplot()` to create a histogram. For more information on creating plots in `ggplot2`, see our tutorials on <a href="https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2017/01/29/datavis.html" target="_blank">basic data visualisation</a> and <a href="https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2017/03/29/data-vis-2.html" target="_blank">customising ggplot graphs</a>. 

Outputs are created by placing code in the curly brackets (`{}`) in the `server` object:

```r
server <- function(input, output) {
  output$plot <- renderPlot(ggplot(Barley, aes(x = yield)) +  # Create object called `output$plot` with a ggplot inside it
  geom_histogram(bins = 7,  # Add a histogram to the plot
    fill = "grey"  # Make the fill colour grey
    data = Barley,  # Use data from `Barley`
    colour = "black")  # Outline the bins in black
  )                                                       
}
```

Look at the code above for a couple of minutes to understand what is going on, then copy and paste into your own `app.R`.

Basically, we are creating an object called `output$plot` and using `renderPlot()` to wrap a `ggplot()` command.

### Reactive output

The histogram is great, but not particularly interactive. We need to link our input widgets to our output object.

We want to select individual genotypes to display in our histogram which the user can select using the `selectInput` that we called `genotype` earlier. Use some base R wizardry, `[]` `$` and `==`, to select the data we want:

```r
server <- function(input, output) {
  output$plot <- renderPlot(ggplot(Barley, aes(x = yield)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 7,
      fill = "grey",
      data = Barley[Barley$gen == input$genotype,],
      colour = "black")
  )                                                       
}
```

`data = Barley[Barley$Genotype == input$select,]` tells `geom_histogram()` to only use data where the value in column `gen` is equal to (`==`) the value given by `input$genotype`. Note the `,` after `input$genotype` which indicates that we are selecting columns, and that all the rows should be selected.

Next, we want to be able to change the colour of the histogram based on the value of the `selectInput` called `colour`. To do this simply change fill = "grey" to `fill = input$colour`:

Next, we want to select the number of bins in the histogram using the `sliderInput` called `bin`. Simply change `bins = 7` to `bins = input$bin`

Finally, to create a table output showing some summary statistics of the selected genotype, create a new output object called `output$table` and use `renderTable()` to create a table generated using dplyr `summarise()`. See our <a href="https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2017/01/16/piping.html#dplyr" target="_blank">tutorial on data manipulation</a> for more information on dplyr:

```r
server <- function(input, output) {
  
  output$plot <- renderPlot(ggplot(Barley, aes(x = yield)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = input$bin,
               fill = input$colour,
               data=Barley[Barley$gen == input$genotype,]))
  
  output$table <- renderTable(Barley %>%  # Use the Barley data frame in a table
  	filter(gen == input$gen) %>%  # Filter the data according to which genotype is selected
	summarise("Mean" = mean(yield),  # Create summary statistics and give them names
		  "Median" = median(yield),
  		  "STDEV" = sd(yield), 
      	          "Min" = min(yield),
       		  "Max" = max(yield)))             
}
```

### Displaying output

To make the outputs appear on your app in the `mainPanel`, they need to be added to the `ui` object inside `mainPanel()` like so:

```r
ui <- 
  fluidPage(
    titlePanel(title = (h4("Barley Yield", align = "center"))),
    sidebarLayout(
      position = "right",
      sidebarPanel(h3("Inputs for histogram"), 
                   selectInput("genotype", "1. Select genotype", choices = c("A" = "a","B" = "b","C" = "c","D" = "d","E" = "e","F" = "f","G" = "g","H" = "h"), selected = "a"),
                   br(),
                   selectInput("colour", "2. Select histogram colour", choices = c("blue","green","red","purple","grey"), selected = "grey"),
                   br(),
                   sliderInput("bin", "3. Select number of histogram bins", min=1, max=25, value= c(10)),
                   br()
                   )
                   mainPanel(
                             plotOutput("plot"),
                             tableOutput("table")
                             )
      )
    )
```

__Take this chance to preview your app again by clicking `Run` in RStudio.__

### Additional elements

#### HTML

To make your app look more pretty, you can add HTML tags like in a normal HTML webpage. Below is a table of basic HTML tags, their Shiny equivalent, and a description of what they do:

HTML    | Shiny                                | Function
------- | :------------------------------------: | ----------------------------------------
`<div>` | `tags$div()`                              | Defines a block with consistent formatting
`<br>`  | `tags$br()`                               | Inserts a break
`<hr>`  | `tags$hr()`                               | Inserts a horizontal line
`<p>`   | `tags$p()`                                | Creates a paragraph of text
`<a>`   | `tags$a(href = "LINK", "displayed text")` | Creates a clickable link

A list of all HTML tags can be found using:

```r
shiny::tags
```

Some tags may conflict with other functions and so you should always state the source the function comes from by using `tags$`, e.g.:

```r
tags$div()
```

Tags can be stacked to apply many arguments to the same object/text, just as in HTML:

```r
tags$div(style="color:red",
  tags$p("Visit us at:"),
  tags$a(href = "https://ourcodingclub.github.io", "Coding Club")
  )
```

This creates a block of text that is coloured red (`style="color:red"`), within that block there is a paragraph of text (`tags$p("Visit us at?:")`) and a link (`tags$a(href = "http://ourcodingglub.github.io", "Coding Club")`).

Add it to your Shiny app in `mainPanel()` and see what happens!

For more information on the arguments that can be included in popular Shiny HTML tags, RStudio have a nice wiki at <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/tag-glossary.html" target="_blank">https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/tag-glossary.html</a>.

<a name="export"></a>

### Exporting a finished app

#### As a github repository

It is easy to send a Shiny app to somebody else who also has RStudio. The easiest way is to send `app.R` alongside any data and other resources in a zip file to be unzipped by the recipient and run through R.

If you want to quickly share the app over the internet we recommend using <a href="http://www.github.com" target="_blank">Github</a> to host the file.

Go to <a href="http://www.github.com" target="_blank">Github</a>, sign in with your account details, create a repository and upload everything from your app folder, including any `Data` and `www` folders. 

Remember to add a file called `README.md` using `Create new file` in your new app repository, where you can write a quick explanation of the content of your app. `.md` files can use markdown syntax to create headers, sections, links etc.. See our <a href="https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2016/11/24/rmarkdown-1.html" target="_blank">tutorial on markdown and reproducible research</a> for more markdown tips:

<center> <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/github_create_new_file.jpg" alt="Img" style="width: 800px;"/> </center>


To send the app to another person, give them your Github username and the name of the app repo and ask them to run `runGithub()` in R, like this:

```r
runGitHub(repo = "repo_name", username = "user_name")
```

Alternatively, if your recipient doesn't know how Github works, upload your app folder as a `.zip` file to Github or any other file-hosting service and they can use `runUrl()` if you give them the url of the zipfile:

```r
runUrl("https://github.com/rstudio/shiny_example/archive/master.zip")
```

To learn more about Github, check out our <a href="https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2017/02/27/git.html" target="_blank">tutorial on Git and Github</a>.

#### As a shinyapps.io app

You can also host Shiny apps on <a href="https://www.shinyapps.io" target="_blank">www.shinyapps.io</a>, a webhosting platform run by R Studio that is especially built for Shiny apps. Go to their website and sign up using whatever method you choose, then go to <a href="https://www.shinyapps.io/admin/#/tokens" target="_blank">www.shinyapps.io/admin/#/tokens</a>, click _Show secret_ and copy the `rsconnect` account info:

![Img]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/shinyapps_io_token.jpg)

Then open up an R session and run the copied material to link `shinyapps.io` with R Studio.

To upload your app, open your `app.R` and click the publish button, select a name for your app (__no spaces__) and click _Publish_. 

<center> <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/rstudio_shiny_publish.jpg" alt="Img" style="width: 600px;"/> </center>

The app can then be used by anyone with the URL for that app, which can be found by going to `shinyapps.io` and opening the app info from the dashboard:

<center> <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/shinyapps_io_dash.jpg" alt="Img" style="width: 700px;"/> </center>

To embed an app that is hosted by `shinyapps.io` in your own website you can put it in an `iframe`, replacing the URL with your own app URL and altering the style arguments to your own desire:

```html
<iframe src="https://johngodlee.shinyapps.io/barley_yield_exploration/" style="border:none;width:1000px;height:500px;"></iframe>
```

<a name="challenge"></a>

### Challenge yourself to emulate a Shiny app

Now that you have the skills to create a Shiny app, try to re-create one of the apps in the links below, then publish it to your `shinyapps.io` profile. The data for these apps, as well as the code for the apps in case you get stuck, can be found in <a href="https://github.com/ourcodingclub/CC-11-Shiny" target="_blank">the repository for this tutorial</a> in the `Challenge Apps` folder.
